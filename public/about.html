<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! I’m Harini, a Computer Science engineering student with a growing passion for web development and design. I'm currently learning full stack development, starting with the basics like HTML and CSS, and slowly moving toward more advanced concepts like JavaScript, databases, and backend frameworks. I believe that every small step matters, and creating this portfolio is my way of showing how I’m turning learning into action..</p>

<p>I enjoy building projects that are simple yet meaningful — like this movie ranking site you’re viewing now. I’m also exploring areas like DevOps and cloud computing to become a well-rounded developer. Apart from tech, I love storytelling, whether it’s through code, poetry, or daydreams about owning a cozy little bookstore someday.

</p>

<p>This website is just the beginning. My goal is to keep learning, growing, and creating things that make people’s lives easier or more enjoyable. Thank you for visiting my space on the internet — I hope you'll check back in as I continue this exciting journey!</p>
